fnt - f* networked tiddlers

A simple JavaScript library for getting, putting and deleting tiddlers 
implemented in an intentionally naive and simple way, to see if the simple
cases can be covered simply, by leaving out the complex cases.

This is essentially a duplicate of code I've written over and over again
in various SPAs.

See index.html for sample use.

Thanks to @fnd for the name.
